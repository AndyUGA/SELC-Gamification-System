Things I planned for all attendee objects to hold: 
- Name
    id: attendeeText
- University 
    id: attendeeText
- Photo
    id: attendeePic (use to change fam color)
- Points
    id: points
- Rank
    id: rank
- Family
    Family Color
    Family Points
        id: fpoints
    Family Rank
        id: frank
    Family members (id: family-Section)
        (array holding more attendee objects?) 
        (how to keep from infinite recursive mess?)
        display all family list except attendee.name for fam section
- their SELC Schedule (with placeholder until they register for workshops)
    Friday = [ {time: "XX", name: "XX"} ] 
    Saturday
    Sunday
    id: fri, sat, sun
